Requirements
------------

django-sesame is tested with:

- Django 3.2 (LTS) and 4.0;
- Python â‰¥ 3.6.

It requires ``django.contrib.auth``.

Getting started
---------------

Install django-sesame:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install django-sesame

Open your project settings and add ``"sesame.backends.ModelBackend"`` to the
:setting:`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` setting. Extending the default value, this
looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
        "django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend",
        "sesame.backends.ModelBackend",
    ]

Now, your project can authenticate users based on django-sesame tokens.

(In)security
------------

.. warning::

    **Before using django-sesame in your project, please review the following
    advice carefully.** (Also, please don't use security-sensitive libraries
    published by strangers on the Internet without checking what they do.)

The major security weakness in django-sesame is a direct consequence of the
feature it implements: **whoever obtains an authentication token will be able
to authenticate to your website.**

URLs end up in countless insecure places: emails, referer headers, proxy logs,
browser history, etc. You can't avoid that. At best you can mitigate it by
creating short-lived or single-use tokens, as described below.

Otherwise, a reasonable attempt was made to provide a secure solution. Tokens
are secured with modern cryptography. There are configurable options for token
expiration and invalidation.
